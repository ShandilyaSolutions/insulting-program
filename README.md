@ZackFreedman's insult generator mixed with gTTS


Zack Freedman is one of my favourite youtubers. I like him for his nerdy vibes, cool projects and of course for his awesome handwriting.
Here is his youtube channel links :

Apart from his awesome projects, he has also created one of the best discord server where you can spend hours without being bored for a second.

When Zack announced he will be opensourcing his insult generator code, I was most interested to include in into my projects. But I couldn't find any interesting ideas so I am here just converting it to speech as you know speech hurts more than words. So, I have added text to speech capability to this program that means it will speak the insulting words instead of showing them in you r output screen.

You are free to use it wherever you wish, and thank Zack for this awesome funny thing.
 

## How to use this code:
1. Clone this repository using whatever tool you use 
    -`git clone git@github.com:ShandilyaSolutions/insulting-program.git` (SSH)
    -`https://github.com/ShandilyaSolutions/insulting-program.git` (HTTPS)
    
    I assume that you know how to clone a git repository, if you don't there is a youtube vedio link teaching the same.
    -[How to clone a github repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Bj-jTkhlTw)

2. After cloning is done open the folder is cloned, open it in a code editor. (You can use anything but here I have assumed that you have PyCharm and you      are using that.) Now, open a terminal and download the following dependencies : 
      -a. gTTS
          -`$ pip install gTTS`
      
      -b. playsound
          -`$ pip install playsound`
        
3. Once evrything is done without any errors, you can go to insult_generator.py and run it. Make sure that your speaker is not muted and you will be        hearing nice authentic & classy insult.
